# date_night_project

I created a binary search tree to store movie titles with their scores.  This was one of my first projects working with ruby and I learned a lot about testing, using class variables (or why I usually shouldn't), and about the implementation of recursion.

To run my program you need to:
<br>
1. Clone this repository
<br>
2. Enter 'cd date_night_project' into your terminal
<br>
3. Enter 'ruby test/date_night_test.rb' into your terminal
<br>
